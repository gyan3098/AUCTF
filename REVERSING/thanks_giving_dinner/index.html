			<p>This is a pwn challenge from AUCTF. </p>

			<p>If we disassemble the code (Here I have use gdb as well as ghidra tool to disassemble) ,then we would find that </p>
			<img src="disassembled_turkey.png" alt="disassembled_turkey">
			<p>the vulnerability in the code is that it assign space for 16 byte but it takes for 36 bytes.</p>
			<p>The 20 bytes(36 bytes - 16 bytes) space are used to assign value to the other 4 variables. </p>
			<img src="turkey_variable.png" alt="turkey_variable">
			<p>If we see closely then we would find that base pointer ebp takes the char value from [ebp-0x2c] and starts filling the stack</p>
			<p>Since value are assigned from top to bottom for the stack .We will fill the value to the space assigned to different variables</p>
			<p>Let's see the disassembled program and it's equivalent C program</p>
			<p>So address assigned for variables
			<ul>local_10 is [ebp-0xc] </ul>
			<ul>local_14 is [ebp-0x10] </ul>
			<ul>local_18 is [ebp-0x14]</ul>
			<ul>local_1c is [ebo-0x18]</ul>
			<ul>local_20 is [ebp-0x1c]</ul>
			<ul>local_2c is [ebp-0x2c]</ul>
			<img src="variable_compare.png" alt="comparing the variables">
			<p> Now we have to do only one thing we have to assign value to variables such that they all occupy 4 bytes in the memory</p>
			<p>For the if statement to be run it should be true to all conditions</p>
			<p>local_10 should be equal to 0x1337</p>
			<p>local_14 should be less than -0x14(means less than 0xffffffec)<p>
			<p>local_18 should be equal to 0x667463</p>
			<p>local_1c should not be equal to 0x14</p>
			<p>local_20 should be equal to 0x2a</p>
			<p>Therefore the value that should be assigned to the different variables are</p>
			<img src="value.png" alt="values">
			<p>Link to my python file is <a href="turkey.py"></a></p>
			<p>After that we have to run the python file and redirects its output to the nc session<p>
			<p> "bash>:"python exploit.py > nc -session</p>
			<p> And Hurray we got the flag : auctf{I_s@id_1_w@s_fu11!}</p>
